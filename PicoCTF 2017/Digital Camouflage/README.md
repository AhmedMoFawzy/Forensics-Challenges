## Description

> We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: [data.pcap.](https://github.com/AhmedMoFawzy/Forensics-Challenges/blob/main/PicoCTF%202017/Digital%20Camouflage/data.pcap)

  <summary>Hint</summary>
   
 #### It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture? If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted.
